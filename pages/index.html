<h1 id="PlanNet-Directory">Payer Directory Implementation Guide</h1>
<h2 id="Introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>The Payer Directory Implementation Guide (Provider Directory IG) is based on <a href="http://build.fhir.org/">FHIR R4.0</a>. It was developed in cooperation with the Da Vinci Project and the the <a href="http://www.healthit.gov/newsroom/about-onc">Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC)</a> with guidance from HL7 International, the Patient Administration Workgroup, and the HL7 US Realm Steering Committee.</p>
<p>It describes the architectural considerations for a payer to share their provider directory. We have strived to make this guide as broadly applicable as possible. However, every implementation may not use all of the content in this guide. It serves as a &ldquo;standard&rdquo; for the exchange of provider data, while describing additional data elements and capabilities that support more robust implementations.</p>

<h2 id="Relation">Relation to US Core and other IGs</h2>
<p>This implementation guide was written for a US audience and profiles resources from the R4 version of the US Core IG, where available (Practitioner, PractitionerRole, Organization and Location), and otherwise from R4 (OrganizationAffiliation, HealthCareService, Endpoint).   Alignment with VhDir is maintained by using extensions from VhDir where possible.
</p>

<h2 id="Background">Background</h2>
<p>Provider directories play a critical role in enabling identification of individual providers and provider organizations, as well as characteristics about them. Provider directories support a variety of use cases, including:</p>

<ul>

<li>Patient/Payer focused
<ul>
<li>Find provider accessibility information (specialty, office hours, languages spoken, taking patients) - enables individuals and consumers to find contact and other accessibility information for individual healthcare providers and/or healthcare organizations</li>
<li>Relationship between provider and insurance plan (insurance accepted) or plan and provider (network) - enables individual healthcare providers, organizations, and payers to discover the relationships between providers, organizations, and payers, as well as additional details about the relationships and entities involved</li>
</ul>
<li>Basic Information Exchange
<ul>
<li>Enable electronic exchange (e.g. discovery of electronic endpoints such as IHE/EHR endpoints, FHIR server URLs, Direct addresses) - enables the electronic exchange of health information by supporting the ability to discover electronic service information including electronic endpoints or electronic addresses</li>
<li>Find an individual and/or organization (even if no electronic endpoint is available) - enables users to find contact and other identifying information about healthcare organizations and individual healthcare providers</li>
</ul>
</li>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="usecase">UseCases</h2>
<ul>
<li>Find Information about a Specific Practitioner</li>
<ul>
<li>Lookup by Name</li>
<li>Lookup by NPI</li>

<h2 id="overview">Overview of Payer Directory - Resource Relationships</h2>
<p>Note: the following diagrams provide a high-level view of the relationships between resources used in this IG. 
    They do not necessarily reflect all of the relationships/references between resources.</p>
<h3 id="practitioner">Practitioner</h3>
<p>A practitioner is a person who is directly or indirectly involved in the provisioning of healthcare.</p>
<h3 id="practitioner-role">Practitioner Role</h3>
<p>PractionerRole describes the relationship between a practitioner and an organization. A practitioner provides services to the organization at a location. Practitioners also participate in healthcare provider insurance networks through their role at an organization.</p>
<p><strong>Figure 1: Practitioner and PractionerRole </strong></p>
<img src="PractitionerRole.png" alt = "Practitioner and PractitionerRole" width="30%" height="30%" />
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="organization">Organization</h3>
<p><strong>Figure 2: Organization </strong></p>
<img src="Organization.png" alt="Organization" width="30%" height="30%" />
<p>&nbsp;</p><h3 id="organization-affiliation">Organization Affiliation</h3>
<p>Similar to PractitionerRole, OrganizationAffiliation describes relationships between organizations. For example: 1) the relationship between an organization and an association it is a member of (e.g. hospitals in a hospital association), 2) an organization that provides services to another organization, such as an organization contracted to provide mental health care for another organization as part of a healthcare provider insurance network, and 3) distinct organizations forming a partnership to provide services (e.g. a cancer center).</p>
<p><strong>Figure 3: OrganizationAffiliation </strong></p>
<img src="OrganizationAffiliation.png" alt="Organization Affiliation"  width="30%" height="30%"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="insurance-plan">InsurancePlan</h3>
<p>
InsurancePlan describes a health insurance offering comprised of a list of covered benefits (i.e. the product), costs associated with those benefits (i.e. the plan), and additional information about the offering, such as who it is owned and administered by, a coverage area, contact information, etc.
</p>
<p><strong>Figure 4: InsurancePlan </strong></p>
<img src="InsurancePlan.png" alt="Insurance Plan" width="30%" height="30%"/>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 id="healthcare-service">Healthcare Service </h3>
<p>
The HealthcareService resource is used to describe a single healthcare service or category of services that are provided by an organization at a location.
The location of the services could be virtual, as with telemedicine services.
</p>
<p><strong>Figure 5: Healthcare Service </strong></p>
<img src="HealthcareService.png" alt = "HealthcareService" width="30%" height="30%"/>
<h3 id="endpoint">Endpoint</h3>
<p>
    An endpoint describes the technical details of a location that can be connected to for the delivery/retrieval of information. Sufficient information is required to ensure that a connection can be made securely, and appropriate data transmitted as defined by the endpoint owner.
</p>
<h3 id="location">Location</h3>
<p>
 A Location includes both incidental locations (a place which is used for healthcare without prior designation or authorization) and dedicated, formally appointed locations. Locations may be private, public, mobile or fixed and scale from small freezers to full hospital buildings or parking garages.   
</p>
<h3 id="network">Network</h3>
<p>A network is a group of practitioners and organizations that provide healthcare services for individuals enrolled in a health insurance product/plan (typically on behalf of a payer).</p>

<p>General Security Considerations</p>
<p>The following are the Provider Directory security considerations that implementers should follow:</p>
<ul>
<li>All implementers of FHIR servers and clients should pay attention to <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/security.html">FHIR Security</a></li>
</ul>
<p>The following are security conformance requirements for Provider Directory actors:</p>
<ul>
<li>Provider Directory actors <em>SHALL</em> use the <a href="http://docs.smarthealthit.org/authorization/backend-services/">SMART Backend Services Authorization Guide</a> to collect the necessary requestor information appropriate for making the Provider Directory data request.</li>
<li>Provider Directory actors <em>SHALL</em> reference a single time source to establish a common time base for security auditing across the system.</li>
<li>Provider Directory actors <em>SHALL</em> use the <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/auditevent.html">AuditEvent</a> resource to capture audit logs of the various transactions. Provider Directory actors <em>SHOULD</em> capture as many AuditEvent resource data elements as appropriate based on requirements of FHIR <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/security.html#audit">Audit Logging</a> and local policies.</li>
<li>Provider Directory actors <em>SHALL</em> conform to <a href="http://hl7.org/fhir/STU3/security.html#http">FHIR Communications</a></li>
</ul>
