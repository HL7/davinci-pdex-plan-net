This implementation guide is dependent on other specifications. Please submit any comments you have on these base specifications as follows:

- Feedback on the FHIR core specification should be submitted to the [FHIR gForge tracker](http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&tracker_id=677) with "FHIR Core" as the specification.

- Feedback on the US core profiles should be submitted to the [FHIR gForge tracker](http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&tracker_id=677) with "US Core" as the specification.

- Individuals interested in participating in Payer Data exchange (PDex) or other HL7 Da Vinci projects can find information about Da Vinci [here](http://www.hl7.org/about/davinci).

Wherever possible, the PDex-plan-net IG will use established US Core Profiles or [Validated Healthcare Directory Implementation Guide](http://build.fhir.org/ig/HL7/VhDir/index.html) (VHDir IG) profiles. Where information must be presented in FHIR resources that fall outside of these Implementation Guides (IG) the HL7 Da Vinci Health Record exchange (HRex) IG will define the necessary Da Vinci FHIR profiles or will refer to other Implementation Guides, as necessary.

Where profiles are specific to the PDex Plan Network use case and are not shared with other Da Vinci IGs the profiles will be defined in the PDex-plan-net-IG itself.


There are a few places in this implementation guide marked as **TODO**. All such areas represent supplementary content such as examples, additional background or context or other non-definitional content. I.e. they do not change any of the conformance expectations on implementers. Where **TODO** appears, such content will be created and included in the IG prior to publication as a Standard for Trial Use.
