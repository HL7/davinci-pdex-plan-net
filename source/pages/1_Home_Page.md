This is a first version of Payer Data exchange Plan Network (PDex-plan-net) Implementation Guide (IG). There is no current official version.
</p>

This specification is currently undergoing ballot and connectathon testing. It is expected to evolve, possibly significantly, as part of that process.

Feedback is welcome and may be submitted through the [FHIR gForge tracker](http://gforge.hl7.org/gf/project/fhir/tracker/?action=TrackerItemAdd&tracker_id=677/) indicating US Da Vinci PDex-plan-net as the specification. If balloting on this IG, please submit your comments via the tracker and just reference them in your ballot submission.

This IG is based on the [HL7 FHIR](http://build.fhir.org/index.html) R4 standard. It identifies the FHIR Profiles needed to provide an Application Programming Interface (API) that provides Health Plan Members with information about the plan's Healthcare and Pharmacy network or directory.

Wherever possible the IG references established profiles and **SHALL** only define new profiles where suitable profiles are not available in published and balloted HL7 FHIR IGs.

This IG **SHOULD** be read in conjunction with the HL7 Da Vinci Payer Data Exchange IG and the HL7 Da Vinci Health Record Exchange IG.
