This implementation guide (IG) uses specific terminology to flag statements that have relevance for the evaluation of conformance with the guide:

**SHALL** indicates requirements that must be met to be conformant with the specification.

**SHOULD** indicates behaviors that are strongly recommended (and which may result in interoperability issues or sub-optimal behavior if not adhered to) but which do not, for this version of the specification, affect the determination of specification conformance.

**MAY** describes optional behaviors that are free to consider but where there is no recommendation for, or against, adoption.

For Health Plans/Payers the individuals who are covered by the plan **MAY** be referred to using any of the following terms, depending on the context or the fields used to identify individuals in FHIR resources:

- **patient** or **subject** id. These terms are typically used in the clinical setting to identify a patient/subject.
- **subscriber** or **member** id These terms are typically used to identify a member of the health plan.
