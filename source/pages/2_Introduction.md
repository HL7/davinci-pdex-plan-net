The PDex-plan-net IG identifies: 
- The actors involved.
- The profiles for the FHIR resources that **SHALL** be communicated. 
- The authorization methods that **SHALL** be used to enable Health Plan Members to authorize access to Third Party Applications.

The IG covers the FHIR Profiles required to support Member-authorized access to Health Plan Healthcare and Pharmacy Network information by Third Party Applications.

The objectives of the IG include:
- Minimizing the proliferation of FHIR profiles by encouraging the re-use of FHIR profiles that have seen significant effort invested in development and implementation.
- Consolidating the number of operational interfaces that Health Plans need to maintain in order to meet regulatory requirements relating to Member access to information via open standard APIs.
