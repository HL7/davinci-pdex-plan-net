<h3>Implementation Guidance</h3>

<ul>
<li>The Plan-Net Network and Organization profiles are both based on the Organization profile.   To selectively query only Network profiles, search for type = 'ntwk'. To selectively query only Organization profiles, search 
for type = 'fac,bus,prvgrp,payer,atyprv'. </li>
<li>When the contact is a department name, rather than a human (e.g., patient help line), include a blank family and given name, and provide the department name (e.g., billing) in contact.name.text.
</li>
</ul>
