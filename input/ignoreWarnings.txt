# 4 - Acknowledge this IG is using code systems that are draft in THO
INFORMATION: OrganizationAffiliation/HartfordOrthopedicAffil: OrganizationAffiliation.code[0]: Reference to draft CodeSystem http://hl7.org/fhir/organization-role|4.0.1


# 5 - Information Message regarding a deprecated extension (maxValueSet), that was inherited through the FHIR R4 standard itself.
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/plannet-Endpoint: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[4].binding.extension[0]: The extension http://hl7.org/fhir/StructureDefinition/elementdefinition-maxValueSet|5.2.0 is deprecated

# 6 - "All slices" constraints on the repeating element are either inherited from US Core and/or are explicitly meant to apply across all slices

INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/plannet-Network: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[19].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/plannet-Network: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[20].pattern.ofType(Identifier): The repeating element has a pattern. The pattern will apply to all the repeats (this has not been clear to all users)

# 7 - Deprecated pattern slicing from an inherited US Core profile
INFORMATION: StructureDefinition/plannet-Network: StructureDefinition.snapshot.element[10].slicing.discriminator[0]: The discriminator type 'pattern' is deprecated in R5+. For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)

For future compatibility, you could consider using type=value with a pattern[x] instead (if this is not an inherited slicing)
