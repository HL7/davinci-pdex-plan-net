<h3>Implementation Guidance</h3>
<p>There is currently no implementation guidance.</p>
Profiling PractitionerRole to set
<ul>
<li>Practitioner to 0..1 to allow a role definition without assigning to a specific practitioner</li>
<li>Organization to 0..1 to allow an individual practitioner that does not have an organization with an NPI.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Need to add implementation guidance and examples as per GailK:
<p>
I believe that we have had the bulk, if not all, of the conversation around the issue and its more about ensuring the needed documentation is included in the IG.
<p>
Iâ€™m hoping we can achieve the following:
<p>
<ul>
<li>Clarify in the IG that it includes not only practitioners but also provider organizations, i.e. groups of practitioners and facilities (used here to collectively refer to all brick and mortar type providers)</li>
<li>Include some examples of organization providers, e.g. hospitals, home health agency, group of practitioners</li>
<li>Include example and a use case for a practitioner without an organization, i.e. sole proprietor</li>
<li>Include example and a use case for accessing a provider organization, e.g. laboratory</li>
<p>

Another example that might be useful but I think we would need some additional SME, is for pharmacy providers. The use case of retail health centers in pharmacies is going to be different from that of a pharmacy where prescriptions are filled. I can help with the first one, but many Plans use Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) for their drug benefit products and I am less versed in how pharmacy contracting, etc. is done.
<p>
Thanks!
